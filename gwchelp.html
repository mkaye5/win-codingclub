		<h1>What Can I Do To Help?</h1>

		<p><b> Recycle</b> </p>
		Even though you’ve been told to recycle countless times, it really makes a difference. 3 - 6 BILLION trees are cut down every year, to create paper that you use. The more you recycle, the more that you can reuse, so that you won’t need more paper. But, make sure that you don’t recycle your homework! :D 
		<p>
		<b>Save your water</b>
		</p>
		When you are brushing your teeth, or washing an apple, DO NOT leave the water running!!! When, let’s say, you are putting toothpaste on your toothbrush, turn off the faucet. Even if you are wasting a few drops of water, there are about 6 billion people in the world. If they all waste a few drops of water, that is like a whole lake wasted! :D
		<p>
		<b>Try to not use your car too much</b>
		</p>
		There is a lot of stuff that comes from a car, that you might not even know about. This is the main reason that global warming is happening now! Instead, when going somewhere, walk, or ride a bike, it's good exercise anyway! :D

		<p>
		<b>Compost</b>
		</p>

		Look, I know it's a lot like recycling, well, it is recycling, but with food and some other objects, not your homework!!! Compost can help food grow, so it helps your trees grow, which help them create more clean air in the world. So, in conclusion, compost, so you don’t die of suffocation! :D</h3></b>
